# Infrastructure project 

This project deploys a sample 2 Tier web applciation using NGINX to serve static content and tomcat to host the dynamic content. NGINX and tomcat are hosted in seperate containers and connected through a private network. The NGINX container exposes port 80 on the host and is therefore accessible from other hosts.

```
3. ./build-dev.sh
```
Run the container build script to build the base containers
```
4.  ./build-docker-images.sh and you will see the 4 images when you run the docker image ls command
